## *A web application in Django or Flask (perhaps http://www.omahapython.org/blog/ which is currently a WP site)

## *A static site using a static site generator (https://www.fullstackpython.com/static-site-generator.html) (perhaps perhaps http://www.omahapython.org/blog/ which is currently a WP site)

## *Organized open-source project (open ended topic)

## *Some sort of home automation project with HomeAssist (https://www.home-assistant.io/) and raspberry pi 

## *Creative art project with processing.py

## *Public service projects. 
    Example 1: build a local representative / election tracker. Users could track news about particular local office candidates that terminates after election and notifies users of election days. Or, users can track documents, data, or news produced by particular local government offices, departments, or officials. It might notify users of upcoming election with open positions or point users to documentation for running for local office.

    Example 2: build a charity help request app (anything from handing out food to manual labor) where volunteers can accept help requests and search for volunteering opportunities by charity, type of labor, date and time, location, time commitment, etc.

## *Power-pairing sports scheduling app. Local leagues and tournaments could use it to ensure that teams of approximate skill level are playing each other, so there's reduced likelihood of multiple zero-loss teams.

## *Busby has a personal project he's willing to turn more public; SONOS / AirPlay style wireless+/bluetooth synchronized audio; (network-join) proximity greeter

## *Implementing a small block chain to show the concept and how to work a flask app from start to end
